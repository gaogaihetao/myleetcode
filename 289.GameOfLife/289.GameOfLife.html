<p>Given a <i>board</i> with <i>m</i> by <i>n</i> cells, each cell has an initial state <i>live</i> (1) or <i>dead</i> (0). Each cell interacts with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood">eight neighbors</a> (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):</p>

<ol>
	<li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.</li>
	<li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
	<li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..</li>
	<li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

<p>Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state.&nbsp;<span>The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where&nbsp;births and deaths occur simultaneously.</span></p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre><strong>Input: 
</strong><span id="example-input-1-1">[
&nbsp; [0,1,0],
&nbsp; [0,0,1],
&nbsp; [1,1,1],
&nbsp; [0,0,0]
]</span>
<strong>Output: 
</strong><span id="example-output-1">[
&nbsp; [0,0,0],
&nbsp; [1,0,1],
&nbsp; [0,1,1],
&nbsp; [0,1,0]
]</span>
